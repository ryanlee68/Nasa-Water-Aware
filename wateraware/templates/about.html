            <h2>What Can You do to Help?</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Be mindful of what you touch(coral, dangerous animals, sensitive animals, etc) and what you put on before going into water(sun block, deodorants, soaps, etc).</li>
                <li>Keep in mind both that when entering any environment it is in a delicate balance.</li>
                <li><strong>ABSOLUTELY NO</strong> littering; not only extremely disrespectful but also can have serious environmental consequences.</li>
                <li>When laws and regulations for environmental protection are lobbied do your part in both researching the laws affects and voting for and against them.</li>
              </ol>

            <h2>Food for Thought</h2>
              <ul>
                    <li>How are ocean ecosystems and the biodiversity they support influenced by climate and environmental variability and change, and how will these changes occur over time?</li>
                    <li>How do carbon and other elements transition between ocean pools and pass through the Earth System, and how do biogeochemical fluxes impact the ocean and Earth's climate over time?</li>
                    <li>How (and why) is the diversity and geographical distribution of coastal marine habitats changing, and what are the implications for the well-being of human society?</li>
                    <li>How do hazards and pollutants impact the hydrography and biology of the coastal zone? How do they affect us, and can we mitigate their effects?</li>

                <p> Hello,</p>
                <p>To whomever is reading this please know that this webpage was made out of both interest in the topic and motivation
                from the 2023 NASA Hackathon Challenge. It was made by two UC Merced students(one first year and one 3rd year) 
                we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this event and hope to continue perfecting this webpage in hopes 
                to achieve the goals listed above. </p>
